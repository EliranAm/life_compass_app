# Life Compass
This application developed as part of a Hackathon called “Safe Home”. Its for a memorial of Michal Sella who was brutally murdered by her husband. The main goal of the Hackathon is to develop applications and platforms to help people in danger from the close circle such as husband, parent etc.

This is a “Panic Button” mobile application that disguise its self as a normal compass application, and in the moment of truth, use to call for help.

The users can assign as someone is in danger ("Victems") or as someone how wants to help ("Helpers").

The Victems register at the first time providing basic information about themselves such as address, phone number, contacts how can help and give GPS permissions (not mandatory).

The Helpers is register by mail and they will be notify when someone around them calling for help.

In the Victems main screen, when the button is pressed to call for help, its notify "Helpers" with the information and the location asking for help.

The Helpers can answer the call and mark it as handeled so other helpers will know.
